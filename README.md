The ChatGPT-Next-Web project is a robust web application built on a stack of advanced technologies. It utilizes React, a JavaScript library renowned for its efficiency in building user interfaces, and Next.js, a server-side rendering and static site generation framework based on React. The project is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

The design aspect of the application is handled by Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that provides utility classes for rapid UI development. Deployment of the application is managed through Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions. Version control and source code management are facilitated by GitHub.

Recently, the project has been enhanced with several new features:
=================================================================

1. User Registration and Login: Users can now register and log into the application to access services. This feature provides a personalized experience and allows for better user management.

2. Sensitive Word Filtering: The application now includes a sensitive word filter to ensure the content shared within the platform adheres to community guidelines and maintains a respectful environment.

3. User Payment Functionality: Although not currently required, the application has been designed to support user payment functionality. This feature can be activated in the future to monetize certain services.
